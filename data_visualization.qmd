![Portfolio vs Benchmark (Cumulative Return)](docs/images/backtest_chart.jpg){width=90%}

## Visualization: Portfolio vs Benchmark Performance
This visualization presents a cumulative return line chart comparing the performance of my backtested investment portfolio against a benchmark ETF over the period **2019 to 2025**.
The portfolio is constructed using a diversified basket of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with fixed weights, while the benchmark represents broad market performance.

By plotting cumulative returns over time, the chart allows for a direct comparison of how an actively constructed portfolio performs relative to a passive market reference across multiple market cycles.

### What this chart shows
The portfolio consistently outperforms the benchmark over the long run, achieving higher cumulative returns by the end of the period.

Periods of market stress and volatility (such as sharp drawdowns) are clearly visible, allowing comparison of how both the portfolio and benchmark react during downturns.

The visualization highlights the speed and strength of recovery, showing that the portfolio rebounds more effectively than the benchmark after market declines.

Overall performance differences become increasingly pronounced over time, illustrating the impact of portfolio construction decisions on long-term outcomes.

### Why I chose this visualization
I chose a cumulative return line chart because it is the most intuitive and widely used method for evaluating investment performance over time:

- It clearly represents long-term growth trajectories rather than short-term fluctuations.
- It enables direct, like-for-like comparison between two investment strategies on the same scale.
- It makes drawdowns, volatility, and recovery periods visually apparent, which are critical aspects of portfolio analysis.

This form of visualization is commonly used in professional finance and investment research, making it appropriate for communicating results clearly and effectively.

### Key takeaway
Based on this backtest, the portfolio demonstrates stronger long-term performance compared to the benchmark, indicating that diversification and asset allocation choices can meaningfully enhance returns.
However, the chart also shows that the portfolio experiences periods of volatility, reinforcing the importance of evaluating performance alongside risk rather than focusing solely on returns.

This visualization highlights the trade-off between risk and reward, which is a central concept in portfolio management and investment decision-making.

### Portfolio Construction (Context for the Visualization)
The results shown in the visualization are generated from a backtesting system that allows users to:
- Select a time period for analysis
- Define the number of ETFs and their respective weights
- Compare portfolio performance against a chosen benchmark

This context is important because the visualization reflects not only market movements, but also the underlying assumptions and design choices made during portfolio construction.

### Portfolio AI Review
This section presents an AI-generated review of the backtested portfolio based on its historical performance metrics, asset allocation, and risk characteristics.
The AI analyzes quantitative indicators such as cumulative return, volatility, drawdowns, and individual ETF contributions to provide an interpretive summary of the portfolio’s strengths and weaknesses.

Rather than generating new numerical results, the AI serves as a decision-support tool, helping to contextualize the data shown in the visualization and translate technical metrics into actionable insights.

### How the AI review complements the visualization
The AI review complements the portfolio performance chart in several ways:

- It interprets performance trends observed in the cumulative return visualization, such as sustained outperformance or periods of heightened volatility.
- It highlights risk considerations that may not be immediately obvious from the chart alone, including concentration risk or sensitivity to market downturns.
- It provides qualitative insights that help bridge the gap between raw numerical data and investment decision-making.

Together, the visualization and AI review offer a more complete understanding of portfolio behavior than either component alone.

### Key takeaway

The AI review reinforces the insights derived from the visualization by emphasizing that strong returns should always be evaluated alongside risk and portfolio composition.
While the portfolio demonstrates favorable long-term performance, the review highlights the importance of understanding underlying assumptions, market exposure, and risk trade-offs when interpreting backtesting results.

This section illustrates how AI can support more informed, data-driven decisions when used responsibly and in conjunction with clear visual evidence.
