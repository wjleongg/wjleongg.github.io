## My Project

Before entering SIT, I studied Banking and Finance and worked on an entrepreneurship project. My team built a prototype of a crypto platform called "Cryptogenics" that aimed at educating the masses on cryptocurrencies and how to manage their investments.

### Project: Cryptogenics
- Objective: Educate the public on cryptocurrency 
- Tools used: Figma
- Outcome: Interviewed 50 members of the public and received feedback that 70% would try our app
